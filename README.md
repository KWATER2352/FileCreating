# FileCreating

1. A challenge I ran into was initially creating the file the txt file was denying being opened. So, I added more permissions and that seemed to work. However, updating the file confused me since I was unsure if I should just change the original quote or add the contents. However, since the lab asks for updating I added it with additional contents for the file to read.
